## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand flexbox better and how to center my elements. I will probably use this site in the future
- [resource 2](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - This simple site helped me convert from px to rem, although I could have done it myself, this tool made it simpler.
